# A maths website dumper

If you don't know me irl, this script isn't relevant to you.
Else, if you are interrested, DM me for the password and instructions.

How it works :
The script will loop through every line of the website, searching for files and folders.
With the help of folder IDs and files parent IDs, it is able to download and recreate the tree of all documents, only if it isn't already.
